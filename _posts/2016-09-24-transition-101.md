**TL;DR** Nothing really.

# Background knowledge
So after getting more and more interested in the space of security and things a like, i watched and read stuff from a lot of different people. I recently started using [Medium](https://medium.com), which is nice and so, but after seeing a lot of people having control of their content i got inspired to do so myself.

That's the reason Im switching to having my content in the future over here.

# The plan

What i want with my little site on the internet is to teach and inspire people, and get my opinions out their and my knowledge in general in the areas i follow.
