title: Encrypt files and messages with Keybase.io
---

**TL;DR:** Encrypt files and messages to any user of Keybase.

# What is it and how?

Keybase is trying to add a social aspect to the whole era of encryption, to make it more accessible to the general audience, and i think it's a great idea, i think everyone should use and have easy access to encryption.

Keybase is taking your public key and merges it with your social networks; so you can prove you are who you say you are.
And when you want to encrypt something to a person, you just look that person up on keybase and find their username, after finding the username it's as easy as typing this in the command line(there is also a GUI on the website): ***keybase encrypt -m "Test message" username***.

To read more and find documentation just check out their site [Keybase.io](https://keybase.io).
